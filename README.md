# zulip-custom-css
Custom CSS files to modify the Zulip desktop client's user interface:

| Filename                | Description                                                  |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| customize-interface.css | Various tweaks to the user interface e.g. removing elements. |
| darker-theme.css        | Make the dark theme darker and grey instead of blue.         |

These work with version Zulip 6.0. All of the UI items that I use frequently are correctly
coloured, but I'm sure that I missed others. Feel free to fork and fix.
